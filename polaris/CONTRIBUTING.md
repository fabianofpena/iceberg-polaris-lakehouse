# Contributing to Polaris Catalog

Thank you for considering contributing to the Polaris Catalog. Any contribution (code, test cases, documentation, use cases, ...) is valuable!

This documentation will help you get started. 

## Contribute bug reports and feature requests 

You can report an issue in the Polaris Catalog [issue tracker](https://github.com/polaris-catalog/polaris/issues). 

### How to report a bug
Note: If you find a  **security vulnerability**, do _NOT_  open an issue. Please email security [at] polaris.io instead to get advice from maintainers. 

When filing an [issue](https://github.com/polaris-catalog/polaris/issues), make sure to answer these five questions:
1. What version of Polaris Catalog are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

Troubleshooting questions should be posted in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/polaris-catalog/polaris/discussions/categories/q-a) instead of the issue tracker. Maintainers and community members will answer your questions there or ask you to file an issue if youâ€™ve encountered a bug. 

### How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Polaris Catalog aims to provide the Iceberg community with new levels of choice, flexibility and control over their data, with full enterprise security and Apache Iceberg interoperability with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Confluent, Dremio, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Salesforce and more.

If you're looking for a feature that doesn't exist in Polaris Catalog, you're probably not alone. Others likely have similar needs. Please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/polaris-catalog/polaris/issues) describing the feature you'd like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

When creating your feature request, document your requirements first. Please, try to not directly describe the solution.


## Before you begin contributing code 

### Review the License

When contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions use the Apache License version 2. Please ensure you have permission to do this if required by your employer.

### Sign the CLA 
When you submit your first PR to Polaris Catalog, you will need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)](./ICLA.md). If your employer agreement requires you to do so, you may also need someone from your company to also sign the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)](./CCLA.md). Make sure they have the legal authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the company. Please send over your ICLA and CCLA to community [at] polaris.io in order for your pull request to be considered.

You can download a copy of the ICLA [here](./ICLA.md) and the CCLA [here](./CCLA.md).

### Review open issues and discuss your approach

If you want to dive into development yourself then you can check out existing open issues or requests for features that need to be implemented. Take ownership of an issue and try fix it. 

Before starting on a large code change, please describe the concept/design of what you plan to do on the issue/feature request you intend to address. If unsure if the design is good or will be accepted, discuss it with the community in the respective issue first, before you do too much active development. 

### Provide your changes in a Pull Request

The best way to provide changes is to fork Polaris repository on GitHub and provide a Pull Request with your changes. To make it easy to apply your changes please use the following conventions:

* Every Pull Request should have a matching GitHub Issue.
* Create a branch that will house your change:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/polaris-catalog/polaris
cd polaris
git fetch --all
git checkout -b my-branch origin/main
```

  Don't forget to periodically rebase your branch:

```bash
git pull --rebase
git push GitHubUser my-branch --force
```

  Ensure the code is properly formatted:

```bash
./gradlew format
```

* Pull Requests should be based on the `main` branch.
* Test that your changes works by adapting or adding tests. Verify the build passes (see `README.md` for build instructions).
* If your Pull Request has conflicts with the `main` branch, please rebase and fix the conflicts.

## Java version requirements

The Polaris build currently requires Java 21 or later. There are a few tools that help you running the right Java version:

* [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) follow the installation instructions, then run `sdk list java` to see the available distributions and versions, then run `sdk install java <identifer from list>` using the identifier for the distribution and version (>= 21) of your choice.
* [jenv](https://www.jenv.be/) If on a Mac you can use jenv to set the appropriate SDK.
